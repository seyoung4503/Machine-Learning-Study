### Overview
This is the list of publicly available SM datasets that we gathered in our research. It represents a collection of real manufacturing datasets that map the selected categories to allow an evaluation of state-of-the-art AD algorithms in this domain. 

### Reading the Data
The datasets are processed and converted to the Numpy .npz file format, which is a compressed archive of files. This also allows you to work with some of the utilities and code introduced in [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench). You can read a dataset by the following script


```python
import numpy as np
data = np.load('14_PlantMonitoring.npz', allow_pickle=True)
X, y = data['X'], data['y']
```

## Dataset repository

The datasets are processed and converted to the Numpy .npz file format, which is a compressed archive of files. This also allows you to work with some of the utilities and code introduced in [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench).

The list includes links to the original dataset sources so that you can get the original metadata for the datasets.
